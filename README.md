<p>For this project, I will be building a virtual breadboard for the engineering department. The department has an issue with the durability/quality of their breadboards. They tend to break and suffer a lot from wear and tear. The reason this will be different from just using programs like Circuit Maker and Circuit Lab is because you don’t really learn how to make circuits on a breadboard. When I learned digital logic, I knew how to make certain circuits,  however that didn’t really translate to a breadboard. It wasn’t as clear to me how to interact with breadboards. This program would mimic a breadboard as closely as possible so that the exact circuits you make could translate over to a physical program.</p>

### Minimum
- [ ] Drag and drop UI
- [ ] Be able to simulate the situations that are needed in Dr. Russ’s labs
- [ ] Create a chart that would display all the inputs and outputs
- [ ] A clear and organized way to show wires
- [ ] Save file for it to be worked on later or graded
- [ ] LEDs, Switches, Buttons
- [ ] Timing diagrams

### Additional
- [ ] Different views -- A way to simplify all the wires and just see where the ends of the wire is
- [ ] Allow for students to make common mistakes that would happen on a physical breadboard (i.e. put chip on the wrong way or forget to wire up ground)
- [ ] Allow the naming of wires and color coding

### Advanced
- [ ] Put in tips for common mistakes when a student makes them
- [ ] Isolation of specific wires to allow for easy checking




#### Timeline
- Feb 18: Get all software installed and begin playing with it. Learn JavaFX.
- Feb 25: Be able to drag chips onto a breadboard and recognize when there's a wire plugged in next to it
- March 4: Create the logic for the chips
- March 11: Make wires transfer inputs/outputs -- Basically figure out data storage. Begin work on wire management.
- March 18: Work on Data storage continued. Display outputs via LEDs, Table, Timing Tables. Work on code packaging.
- March 25: File Saving. Continue work on wire management by creating a new view.
- April 1: Wire Management continued (renaming, recoloring, isolation). 
- April 8: Allow mistakes to be made. Begin work on creating tips for said mistakes.
- April 15: Aesthetics! Clean up the UI! It should be worked on throughout the semester so this should just be fine tuning.
- April 22: Aesthetics. Final tests for every assignment from Dr. Russ’s labs.
- April 28: Aesthetics.
